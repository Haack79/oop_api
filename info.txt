Okay, 
so For this project i set up a data base, for this project using mongodb + mongoose
this i export to app.ts where I will initialize the project.

SERVER.ts  -
this houses the server class where i encapsulate and abstract the methods that i want, its responsible for
1. setting up Middlware
    a. Cors - cross site origin handling
    b. helmet - security protection from common web vulnerabilities by adding security web headers protecs from xss
        clickjacking etc. csp content security, xss , hides X-powered-by header so wont' get my server info.
    c. morgan - logger milddelware  http request logger
    d. hpp - protect from parameter polution attack like ?user=brian&user=ezra?user=susie etc. 
    e. compression - compresses response body, enables gzip for http responses smaller body = better performance
        reduced bandwidth, better user experience, use threshold and filter, could cause cpu load
2. setting up error handling
3. setting up and starting HTTPServer
